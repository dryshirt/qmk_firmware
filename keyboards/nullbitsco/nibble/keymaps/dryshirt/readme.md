# Dryshirt's Nibble Layout

My personal keymap for the nibble; if you're looking for the keymap that has bongo cat you can actually find it in the official qmk repository in the [example nibble firmwares](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/nullbitsco/nibble/keymaps/oled_bongocat)! Good luck and happy building :>
